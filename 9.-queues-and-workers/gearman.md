# Gearman

## What is Gearman?

## Can I find or create a dockerized environment to play with gearman?

You can use github code search to find something suitable or collect clues on how to create your own.

For example, here are some **curated** results from a search on - [gearman filename:docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/search?utf8=✓&q=gearman+filename%3Adocker-compose.yml&type=Code).

* A [repo](https://github.com/EvaEngine/Dockerfiles) with lots of votes
* A [repo](https://github.com/thinkspill/weather-api) that might use gearman with a real world usecase: `Weather API proxy deployed as a set of docker containers.` Therefore it may be good for learning about how to use gearman.
* A [repo](https://github.com/cbrews/qstate) that might use gearman with a real world usecase: `A multi-container state queue as a service web API.` Therefore it may be good for learning about how to use gearman.
* A [repo](https://github.com/z7zmey/docker) that has gearman and the words `cli-consumer-php` which seems somewhat interesting to explore because our team has previously built CLI based PHP workers for AWS EBS.
* A [repo](https://github.com/dsaouda/docker-gearman) which has scripting instructions in [`docker-entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/dsaouda/docker-gearman/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh) which seem quite important for setting up gearman in a much more robust fashion than anyone else has before.

**Disclaimer**: The search yielded 5 pages of results, as of this writing, we only looked at the first 2 pages and not the remaining ones!
