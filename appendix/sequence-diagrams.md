      > A simple javascript library to turn text into vector UML sequence diagrams. Heavily inspired by websequencediagrams.com, who offer a serverside solution. We use Jison to parse the text, and Snap.svg to draw the image.
* GitBook plugins for generating sequence diagrams:

* Animate Sequence diagrams
  * This [video](https://youtu.be/UJxIPCylCos?t=4) suggests that someone accomplished this task, just not sure how, need to look deeper.
  * This [gist](https://gist.github.com/jzaeske/e2de8b14142818f8d8f5e74e8b6ae2b0) again suggests that someone was able to animate the sequence diagram in `reveal.js`
  * This [issue](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1906) doesn't have to do with animations but it suggests that people often embed and use sequence diagrams with `reveal.js`
