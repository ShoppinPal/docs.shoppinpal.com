# Setup a machine in the cloud

## What is the problem?

I work remotely so when I was presented with an opportunity to travel and work side-by-side with my team, I was quite excited. But just a day before my travel plans, I received an update from `Docker for Mac beta` that made it impossible for me to download any container images due to some `ipv6` issues. After reaching my destination, the bandwidth became a challenge and I also learned that my immediate team found it extremely wasteful to use docker and docker-compose for the same reason. This coupled with the need for slightly more powerful machines \(bigger solid-state-drive `SSD`\), was why docker adoption across our company had been slow! We were well into adopting docker into staging and production but we would always trip over simple issues. It took days to get a solution from developer's environment to the staging environment.

### Author TODOs:

- record a 5 min video where you get a digitalocean machine and set it up
- record a 2 min video where you use a script to set it up
- share the gist for the script for publication
etc.
