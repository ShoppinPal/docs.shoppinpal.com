## For Designers

1. Always use a solid state drive - SSD.
    * Lack of space should be supplemented with a low cost [ultra fit usb flash drive](http://a.co/b827zXr).
1. High CPU - need large amounts of processing power for dealing with a large amount of layers in tools like photoshop
1. High Memory
