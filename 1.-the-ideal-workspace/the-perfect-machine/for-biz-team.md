1. Always use a solid state drive - SSD.
   * Lack of space should be supplemented with a low cost [ultra fit usb flash drive](http://a.co/b827zXr).
2. CPU and memory should be sufficient to allow for the use of following applications in parallel:
   1. VOIP \(voice over IP\) with screen sharing and/or and screen recording. For ex: skype, hipchat, zoom.us, google hangouts, webex, slack, joinme etc.
   2. Browsers with multiple tabs and/or sessions
3. We recommend [Apple 13 inch macbook air](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air)
   * 1.6GHz CPU
   * 8GB Memory
   * 128GB SSD
   * roughly **1,000 USD**
